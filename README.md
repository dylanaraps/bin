# Dylan's Scripts


### bar

Taskbar script.

Depends on:

- Dynamic width: `xorg-xrandr`

- Current song (Spotify): `dbus-send`
- Bar: `lemonbar`
- IP Address: `ip`


### bri

Control brightness.


### grt

My university blocks `ssh` connections so I use this script to toggle my repo remotes to `https` so that I can push/pull changes on their network.

Simple as piss `aur` helper.

Use this to install a real `aur` helper on a fresh install.

- `git`


### scr

Take a screenshot and display a notification.

Depends on:

- Screenshot: `imagemagick`

### spotify

Launch spotify in HI-DPI mode.

This would've been an alias but I wanted this to work with `rofi`.

- Notification: `libnotify`


### wal-set
