# Dylan's Scripts


### bar

Taskbar script.

Depends on:

- Dynamic width: `xorg-xrandr`
- Workspace switcher: `wmctrl`,
- Current song (Spotify): `dbus-send`
- Bar: `lemonbar`
- IP Address: `ip`


### grt

Toggle a `git remote` url to and from `https`/`git`.

My university blocks `ssh` connections so I use this script to toggle my repo remotes to `https` so that I can push/pull changes on their network.


### rof

Run `rofi` with arguments easily.


### saur

Simple as piss `aur` helper.

Use this to install a real `aur` helper on a fresh install.

Depends on:

- `git`


### scr

Take a screenshot and display a notification.

Depends on:

- Screenshot: `imagemagick`
- Notification: `libnotify`


### spotify

Launch spotify in HI-DPI mode.

This would've been an alias but I wanted this to work with `rofi`.


### vol

Simple volume control that works with `alsa` or `pulseaudio`.

Depends on:

- Volume control: `amixer`
- Notification: `libnotify`


### wal-set

Script to update programs with `wal` colors.
